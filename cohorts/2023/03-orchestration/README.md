The Prefect Project functionality need the execution of `prefect init` at the root level of the project, in particular at the same level where the `git init` has been executed to start git versioning the project code.

So to simplify things (as in this course each module is like an autonomous 'project'), the solution has been to develop this module code in a separate github repo at:

So, to give a look to the code, jump to the link above!
